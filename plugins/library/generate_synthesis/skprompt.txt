[INSTRUCTION] You have two tasks:

1. Create a JSON object that will be used for output with the following structure: { "synthesis": { "summary": "" } }
2. Analyze the data section and extract the 'summary' property from each record. Then, concatenate all the 'summary' property values into a single body of text.
4. Use the GPT-35 model to generate a summary based on this single body of text.
5. Store the result from the GPT-35 model from step 4. in the 'summary' property of the 'synthesis' return JSON object you created in task 1.
6. Return the object and store it in the output variable.

Ensure that the output is a well formed JSON object and contains no characters other than those in the JSON structure.
